## Project Description

This project was built by the combined effort of Suman Bhattarai, Paxton Bigler, Jesse Hancock, and Matt Tran. The purpose was to clone portions of Airbnb.com within our limited, two-week timeframe. It was our first opportunity to implement ReactJS and various other resources that were new to one or another of us. 

The portions cloned include: the front page; the profile page; the listing page; the search page; and the become-a-host page. We initially conceived of building a database until we happened upon the Official Unofficial Airbnb API. Our application is able to mount information from that API similar to the native Airbnb site. The profile, listing, and search pages all use this resource. The home and become-a-host pages, are hard-coded data.

The application is also mobile-responsive.
